# Insert Measurement & Identification Worksheet  
## (with ISO Cheat Sheet for Unmarked Inserts)

This worksheet is intended for identifying **completely unmarked lathe inserts**
by direct measurement and visual inspection. It is structured to prevent
misidentification and incorrect re-ordering.

## 1. Insert Identification – Working Record

Use one worksheet per insert *family*.

### 1.1 Physical Measurements

| Inscribed circle (IC) | |
| Thickness | |
| Clearance angle (relief) | |
| Nose radius | |
| Hole type | |
| Chipbreaker (none / light / medium / heavy) | |
| Top surface (ground / molded) | |
| Coating color / type | |
| Material (carbide / HSS / unknown) | |
| Magnetic? (Y/N) | |
| Edge condition | |

### 1.2 Final Determination

| Determined ISO Insert Code | Confidence (High / Medium / Low) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                          |                                  |

## 3. SIZE IDENTIFICATION CHEAT SHEET

### 3.1 Inscribed Circle (IC)

| Code | IC (inches) | IC (mm) |
|----|-------------|---------|
| 06 | ~0.250" | 6.35 mm |
| 09 | ~0.375" | 9.52 mm |
| 12 | ~0.500" | 12.7 mm |
| 16 | ~0.625" | 15.9 mm |

*Measure across the largest circle touching all cutting edges.*

---

### 3.2 Thickness (Typical)

| IC Code | Thickness (in) | Thickness (mm) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 06 | ~0.094" | ~2.38 |
| 09 | ~0.156" | ~3.97 |
| 12 | ~0.187" | ~4.76 |
| 16 | ~0.250" | ~6.35 |

---

## 4. NOSE RADIUS CHEAT SHEET

### 4.1 Common ISO Nose Radii

| Code | Radius (in) | Radius (mm) | Typical Use |
|----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 01 | 0.004" | 0.1 mm | Fine finish |
| 02 | 0.008" | 0.2 mm | Light finishing |
| 04 | 0.016" | 0.4 mm | General purpose |
| 08 | 0.031" | 0.8 mm | Roughing |
| 12 | 0.047" | 1.2 mm | Heavy roughing |

*Best measured with radius gauges or optical comparator.*

## 5. MATERIAL & EDGE IDENTIFICATION

### 5.1 Carbide vs HSS

| Test | Carbide | HSS |
|----|---------|-----|
| Magnet | No | Yes |
| Color | Gray / gold / black | Silver |
| Edge | Very sharp but brittle | Tougher |
| Sound (tap) | Glassy | Dull |

---

### 5.2 Ground vs Molded

| Feature | Ground (G) | Molded (M) |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Edge sharpness | Very sharp | Slight hone |
| Surface | Smooth | Textured |
| Typical use | Finishing | Medium / roughing |

---

## 6. STEP-BY-STEP IDENTIFICATION WORKFLOW

1. Identify **shape** visually → shape code
2. Count edges → confirms shape
3. Measure **IC** → size code
4. Measure **thickness**
5. Determine **relief angle** (positive vs negative)
6. Inspect **hole type**
7. Measure **nose radius**
8. Combine into ISO format:

**[Shape][Relief][Tolerance][Hole][IC][Thickness][Nose Radius]**

Example:  
**CCMT 09T304**
