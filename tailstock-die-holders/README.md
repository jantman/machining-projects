Plans for some lathe tailstock die holders, made on the lathe. These are roughly based on Quinn Dunki's ([blondihacks.com](https://blondihacks.com/)) die holders, based on her drawings and [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9v4FHaAOdg).

They're designed to hold both [GearWrench hexagonal dies](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GMVA64/) as well as standard round dies; specifically, dies that are:

* Large hex fitting in a hex holder 1.425" across flats and 0.520" deep
* Large round fitting in a #5 holder 1.522" diameter and 0.485" deep
* Small hex fitting in a hex holder 1.011" across flats and 0.355" deep
* Small round fitting in a #3 holder 1.020" diameter and 0.365" deep

The holders themselves are designed to slide on a 0.500" rod (I use 1/2" drill rod) and be turned with a 0.250" (1/4" drill rod) tommy bar.
