# Fabricating Wheel Guards for a Tool & Cutter Grinder (6", 7", and 8" Wheels)

## Scope and Intent

This document consolidates design rationale, measurements, materials, and fabrication processes for **fabricating grinding wheel guards** for a vintage tool & cutter grinder (e.g., Cincinnati No. 2 class) using **readily available steel**, a **slip roll**, and a **welder**.

The goal is to produce **functional, mechanically credible guards** that:
- Cover realistic failure modes of vitrified grinding wheels
- Use a **rod-mounted, T-slot-supported system** consistent with original Cincinnati practice
- Are adaptable for **6", 7", and 8" straight wheels**
- Prioritize **energy deflection and survivability**, not cosmetic enclosure or regulatory certification

---

## 1. Design Philosophy (Concise)

- Grinding wheel bursts are **low probability, high consequence** events.
- Guards should **intercept tangential fragments**, especially in the **top and rear quadrants**.
- Steel guards are **energy diffusers**, not armor.
- Mounting integrity matters as much as shell strength.
- Clearance, adjustability, and usability are critical on a T&C grinder.

---

## 2. Wheel Sizes and Design Strategy

### Wheels to be Covered
- 6" OD
- 7" OD
- 8" OD

### Recommended Strategy
Fabricate **one primary guard shell sized for 8" wheels**, with:
- Adequate radial clearance
- Bolt-on or adjustable lower-front "chin" plates to reduce the opening for 6" and 7" wheels

This minimizes fabrication effort while maintaining reasonable coverage for all wheel sizes.

---

## 3. Coverage Geometry Requirements

### Minimum Effective Coverage
- **210–240° total coverage**
- Full coverage of:
  - Top quadrant
  - Rear quadrant
- Front/lower quadrant left open only as required for:
  - Tool access
  - Dressing access

### Radial Clearance
- **0.125"–0.187"** from wheel OD to inside of guard

### Axial (Side) Clearance
- **≥0.125" per side**, more if wide wheels or large blotters are expected

---

## 4. Material Selection

### Primary Guard Shell
- **Material:** Mild steel (ASTM A36 / 1018)
- **Thickness:**
  - 0.125" (1/8") — acceptable if stiffened
  - **0.187" (3/16") — preferred** for one-off fabrication

### End Plates
- 0.125"–0.187" steel plate

### Return Flanges / Stiffeners
- 0.125" steel plate or formed flanges

### Rod Support
- **Steel round bar**
  - Preferred: **5/8" diameter**
  - Minimum: 1/2" diameter

### Fasteners
- Steel only (Grade 5 or better)
- Avoid stainless for primary load paths

---

## 5. Guard Shell Geometry (8" Design Envelope)

### Target Dimensions
- **Wheel radius (8")**: 4.000"
- **Inside guard radius:** 4.125" (includes clearance)
- **Shell width (axial):** 2.0"–2.5" recommended

### Return Flange
- **0.5"–0.75" inward-facing lip** on the front opening
- Improves stiffness and fragment redirection

---

## 6. Fabrication Method (Slip Roll + Welder)

### Step 1 — Patterning
- Mount the largest wheel (8") with flanges installed
- Mock up coverage using cardboard or MDF
- Mark:
  - Required opening
  - Clearance envelope
  - Rod mounting location

### Step 2 — Rolling the Shell
- Cut plate blank sized for ~210–240° arc
- Slip-roll to ~4.125" inside radius
- Verify fit around mounted wheel

*(Segmented shells using 6–8 flat panels welded together are acceptable if rolling is unavailable.)*

### Step 3 — End Plates
- Cut circular or rectangular end plates
- Weld to shell
- Grind internal welds smooth to remove stress risers

### Step 4 — Front Return Flange
- Either:
  - Form a flange before rolling, or
  - Weld a separate strip to the front edge

---

## 7. Mounting System: Rod + T-Slot Block

### Existing Machine Configuration
- Guard mounted via **rod** into a **block fastened in the top T-slot** of the spindle casting

This arrangement is retained and improved.

---

## 8. T-Slot Dimensions (Measured)

Measured slot geometry:

- Mouth (narrow) width: **0.557"**
- Undercut width: **0.959"**
- Undercut height: **0.380"**
- Top of undercut: **0.516" below table top**
- Approximate total depth: **0.896"**

These dimensions correspond closely to a **nominal 9/16" T-slot**.

---

## 9. Recommended T-Nut / Block Design

### T-Nut (in undercut)
- Width: **0.940"**
- Height: **0.360"**
- Length: **1.5"–2.0"**
- Material: 1018 or 4140 prehard
- Add small chamfers and/or corner relief for casting radii

### Neck (through slot mouth)
- Width: **0.540"**

### Thread Size (choose based on block)
- 3/8-16 or 1/2-13 recommended

---

## 10. Upright Rod Clamp Block

Rather than clamping the rod directly in the T-slot:

1. T-nut anchors in slot
2. Upright steel block bolts to T-nut
3. Block contains a **split clamp bore** for the rod

### Block Features
- Bore: reamed to rod diameter (0.500" or 0.625")
- Split saw cut
- Clamp screw perpendicular to split
- Block bears on table top; T-nut floats in undercut

This greatly improves stiffness and impact survivability.

---

## 11. Anti-Rotation and Stability

Single-rod mounts can rotate under impact.

Mitigations (use at least one):
- Small **anti-rotation tab** bearing against spindle housing
- Light **rear stabilizer strut** to wheelhead casting
- Long split clamp contact area on rod

---

## 12. Guards for 6" and 7" Wheels

### Using the 8" Shell
- Install **bolt-on lower-front chin plates**:
  - Deeper chin for 6"
  - Intermediate chin for 7"
- Chin plates reduce the opening without changing the main shell

### Alternative
- Fabricate separate shells per wheel size (more work, marginal benefit)

---

## 13. Finishing and Inspection

- Deburr all internal edges
- Remove sharp corners
- Paint exterior as desired
- Avoid thick paint buildup inside near wheel

### Inspection
- Verify:
  - No interference at full spindle travel
  - Guard cannot rotate into wheel
  - Rod clamp is tight and secure

---

## 14. Operational Notes

- Maintain wheel rated speed
- Inspect wheels before mounting
- Never allow the guard to contact the wheel
- Replace or repair guard after:
  - Any significant impact
  - Visible deformation or cracking

---

## 15. Summary

A properly fabricated steel guard using:
- 1/8"–3/16" mild steel
- ≥210° coverage
- Robust rod-and-T-slot mounting
- Adjustable geometry for multiple wheel sizes

…will **materially outperform most original 1950s guards** while preserving the flexibility required for tool & cutter grinding.

This approach is historically consistent, mechanically sound, and achievable in a small shop with basic fabrication tools.
