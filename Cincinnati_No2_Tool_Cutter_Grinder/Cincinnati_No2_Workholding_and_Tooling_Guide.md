## Machine & Table Context

- **Machine:** Cincinnati No. 2 Tool & Cutter Grinder  
- **Table size:** 6" × 44"  
- **Longitudinal travel:** ~24"  
- **Spindle speed:** 3800 RPM  

### T-Slot Geometry (Measured)

- **Throat (narrow opening):** ~0.557" (≈ 9/16")  
- **Undercut width:** ~0.959"  
- **Undercut height:** ~0.380"  
- **Top of undercut below table surface:** ~0.516"  

### Practical Interpretation

These dimensions correspond closely to **ANSI-style 9/16" T-slots**, intended for **nominal 1/2" T-bolts**.

**In shop terms:**
- Buy hardware marketed as **9/16" T-slot** or **1/2" T-bolt system**
- Thread size typically **1/2-13**

## T-Slot Hardware Buy List (Recommended)

### Core Hardware
- (8–12) **1/2-13 T-slot nuts**, sized for 9/16" slots  
- (8–12) **1/2-13 studs**, assorted lengths (2", 3", 4")  
- (6–8) **Strap clamps** (1/2" system)  
- (6–8) **Step blocks** (matched to strap clamps)  
- (4–6) **Hardened parallels or setup blocks**  

### Optional but Very Useful
- Low-profile **toe clamps** (1/2" system)  
- Assorted **socket-head cap screws** (1/2-13)  
- Ground spacer blocks (shop-made or purchased)

## Tooling Gaps & Budget-Friendly Solutions

### 1. Minimal Surface Grinding Capability

#### Best Value
**Fine-pole permanent magnetic chuck, 6" wide**  
- Ideal size: **6" × 12"**
- Used premium often best value
- Import acceptable for light grinding

#### Interim / Complementary
**Toolmaker’s vise (2"–2.5")**

---

### 2. Holding Lathe Tool Bits for Sharpening

**Toolmaker’s vise + simple angle blocks**
- Repeatable rake and relief
- Safe, rigid presentation

---

### 3. Holding Short Shafts for End Finishing

See part-specific section below.

## Specific Part Geometry

- **Eccentric shaft:** Ø 5/16", length 5/16"  
- **Disc:** Ø 1-1/4", thickness 1/4"  
- **Stem:** Ø 9/16", length 2-3/8" (coaxial)

---

## Recommended Solution for This Part

### Dedicated Grinder-Only 5C Spin Fixture

- Hold part by **9/16" stem** in 5C collet
- Establish fixed axial stop
- Face-grind eccentric shaft end
- Do **not** rotate during grinding

---

## Alternate Solution

### Toolmaker’s Vise + V-Block + Stop

- Immediate, inexpensive
- Less repeatable than collet holding

---

## What You Do Not Need

- Cylindrical grinder
- Eccentric grinding fixtures
- Dividing heads with offsets

---

## Recommended Purchase Priority

1. 1/2-13 T-slot hardware set  
2. Toolmaker’s vise  
3. Dedicated grinder-only 5C spin fixture  
4. Fine-pole magnetic chuck  

---

## Final Notes

This approach maximizes capability while minimizing cost and avoids rare or proprietary tooling.
